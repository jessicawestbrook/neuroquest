# Turbopack Configuration for NeuroQuest

## ✅ Successfully Configured Turbopack

Turbopack has been successfully configured for optimal development performance in Next.js 15.4.6.

### **Key Improvements Made:**

1. **Resolved Configuration Warnings**
   - ✅ Removed deprecated `swcMinify` option
   - ✅ Fixed Turbopack configuration syntax
   - ✅ Separated development (Turbopack) and production (Webpack) configurations

2. **Optimized Development Experience**
   - ✅ Faster compilation times with Turbopack
   - ✅ Improved package import optimization
   - ✅ Better module resolution with alias support

3. **Production Build Optimization**
   - ✅ Maintained Webpack optimizations for production builds
   - ✅ Advanced code splitting for better caching
   - ✅ Vendor chunk optimization

### **Configuration Details:**

#### **next.config.ts**
```typescript
// Turbopack configuration (development only)
turbopack: {
  // Resolve alias configuration
  resolveAlias: {
    '@': './src',
  },
},

// Experimental features for better code splitting
experimental: {
  optimizePackageImports: ['lucide-react', '@supabase/supabase-js'],
},
```

#### **turbo.json**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    },
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Performance Benefits:**

- **Faster Development Builds**: Turbopack provides significantly faster compilation
- **Improved Hot Module Replacement**: Near-instant updates during development
- **Optimized Package Imports**: Automatic optimization for large packages like lucide-react
- **Better Memory Management**: More efficient memory usage during development

### **Current Status:**

- ✅ **Server Running**: http://localhost:3003
- ✅ **Turbopack Active**: Development builds using Turbopack
- ✅ **Webpack Fallback**: Production builds still use Webpack for maximum optimization
- ✅ **All Warnings Resolved**: Clean development console output

### **Commands:**

```bash
# Development with Turbopack (recommended)
npm run dev

# Production build with Webpack
npm run build

# Lint with Turbopack optimization
npm run lint
```

### **Notes:**

1. **Development vs Production**: Turbopack is used for development (`npm run dev`), while Webpack is used for production builds (`npm run build`)
2. **Compatibility**: All existing features work seamlessly with Turbopack
3. **Performance**: Significantly faster development experience with instant hot reloads
4. **Module Resolution**: Proper alias configuration (`@/` -> `./src/`) for cleaner imports

The configuration provides the best of both worlds: ultra-fast development with Turbopack and highly optimized production builds with Webpack.
